The grid is a computing environment comprised of various processors which arrive
at various times and to which jobs can be assigned. We consider the problem of
scheduling a set of jobs, each with a specific memory requirement. When a processor
arrives, it announces its memory capacity. Jobs are assigned to the processor so that
the sum of the requirements of its assigned jobs does not exceed its capacity.
