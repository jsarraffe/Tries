Instructions to run Code:

	program was BUILT ON : CLION 2020.3.3
	My development platform is an  MSI 15.6" GS65 on Windows 10


    NOTE:
           From any given input file, I have striped away all non alpha-numeric characters, and that is reflected in my output.
           For example, the word seventy-five, would be seventyfive.

	Open this project in Clion.

	In CLion type CTRL+ALT+S, and  make sure that you have a compiler selected. I have MinGW as mine. Edit the configurations
	so that the working directory is /Project3b.
	Make sure your program arguments are     <fileName, Flag>

    You can also simply executed this in terminal on blue.

    g++ -std=c++17 *.cpp

    then run the executable

     ./a.out <filename> <flag>
